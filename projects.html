  Some of these are on <a href='http://heroku.com/'>Heroku</a> (on the free tier), so they may have gone to sleep. Please be patient while they wake up. Pretty-much <em>all</em> of them are pointlessly over-engineered...

<ul>
                {% for project in site.data.projects %}
                  <li>
                    <a href='{{ project.url }}'>
                      {{ project.title }}
                    </a>
                  </li>
                {% endfor %}
